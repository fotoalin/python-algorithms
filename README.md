# Python Algorithm Practice

This GitHub repository is a collection of my Python scripts that I have written while practicing algorithms. The main objective of this repository is to showcase my problem-solving skills and demonstrate my understanding of various algorithms and data structures.

The repository currently cover recursion with detailed explanations of the algorithm and trhe approache I have taken to solve the problem. However, I plan to continue adding more scripts as I progress and tackle new challenges.

I hope this repository serves as a helpful resource for other developers who are interested in improving their algorithmic skills in Python. Feel free to explore the scripts and provide feedback or suggestions for improvement.
